## Metagenomix

Metagenomix is a Python module for analyzing species composition of a sequenced sample of DNA or RNA.

## Code Example


Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

To install Metagenomix, first we need to setup the mapping of NCBI gis to taxon identifiers.
The script used to setup the mappings is located in the bin folder. It can be used to download and setup the mappings for both nucleotide and protein gi -> tax mappings.
For instance, if we are to create a database with just the nucleotide mappings, we would run:
```
./bin/setup-taxonomy --nucl
```
This command will download the latest nucleic gi->tax mappings from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy, and create a sqlite3 database with a single table named nucleotide which has two columns: gi and tax. The mapping files are pretty large, and this step can take quite a long time.
The script has some additional options, which can be viewed by running:
```
./bin/setup-taxonomy --help
```
```
python setup.py build install
```
After you've built Metagenomix, you need to download the information on taxa names, ranks and relationships:
```
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdmp.zip
unzip taxdmp.zip
dmp2taxtree nodes.dmp names.dmp ./metagenomix/
python setup.py build install
```
After the build step, you need to setup the gi to taxonomy mapping database which will enable Metagenomix to map particular organism names to your GI identifiers.
